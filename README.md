  ## Description  

  

  This is an exercise in using express to serve a user expereince throuhg a local server that is able to accept and appropriately handle GET, POST, and DELETE http requests.  

  * Motivation  

    To learn how to handle HTTP requests, particularly to connect a user to a database.  

  * Reason for Building  

    To better understand the express suite of tools as well as to glean a better understanding of how server requests are handled through internet traffic and routing.  

  * Problems Solved  

    It connects the work done by the front end developers to the database so users can save personal notes.  

  * Things Learned  

    I learned how URL routing works, how to modularize an application, how to set up a server, and how to work with a database.
